The Paths of Walkers is a side project that I worked on with the new media artist [Yen Tzu Chang](https://changyentzu.com/) . As a part of the exhibition, INCLUDE｜SMA, it is an interactive art installation, where audiences can change images with their motions. We use Open Frameworks for high-quality video rendering and openNi2 with Microsoft Kinect for real-time human motion detection.

> The meaning of freedom is explored again in the works, from understanding SMA to the state of patients facing their bodies, and realizing that freedom exists both on a spiritual and physical level. Despite physical limitations and pain, the feeling of freedom is generated by overcoming the pain, which results in a more comfortable travel environment. Visually, the work is influenced by medical scenes. In the work, the doctor reinterprets and conveys the changing state of life and emotion by reinterpreting the appearance of the skeleton through the X-ray image. During the exploration process, audiences can try to find the best sound and vision through sensors by using various types of materials, normal and distorted skeletons.
